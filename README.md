PREDICTING-MACHINE-FAILURE-IN-ADVANCE
Overview:
  This project, assigned by Coratia Technologies as part of my Data Science internship, focuses on predictive maintenance—a crucial aspect of modern industrial operations. Equipment failure in industries can lead to unexpected downtimes, costly repairs, and significant productivity losses. By leveraging machine learning and data-driven insights, this project aims to predict failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance and optimizing machine efficiency.

  The project follows a structured pipeline that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and predictive modeling using various machine learning techniques. The insights gained from this study can help industries reduce downtime, prevent catastrophic failures, and ultimately save operational costs.

Dataset:
To make accurate predictions, we use a dataset that includes:
1. Sensor readings: Live data from different machine components.
2. Failure records: Labels showing whether a machine failed or not.
3. Timestamps: Time-based information to track trends and patterns.

Data Preprocessing:
Before training a model, we clean and prepare the data by:
1. Handling missing values
2. Normalizing and scaling sensor readings
3. Encoding categorical data for machine learning compatibility
4. Selecting the most relevant features to improve prediction accuracy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
To understand how machines behave before a failure, we analyze patterns like:
1. Correlation between different sensor readings and failure events
2. Identifying unusual spikes or drops in sensor values (anomalies)
3. Trends over time that signal when a machine might break down

Machine Learning Approach:
We experiment with different models to find the best one for failure prediction:
1. Simple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (good for quick insights)
2. Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost (stronger performance)
3. Time-series models: LSTMs (ideal for tracking machine behavior over time)

How We Measure Performance:
To evaluate how well our model predicts failures, we look at:
1. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score – How well does it classify failures?
2. ROC-AUC Curve – How good is the model at distinguishing failures from normal operations?
3. Confusion Matrix – A breakdown of correct vs. incorrect predictions

Results & Insights:
1. Our models provide insights into which sensor readings are most critical for predicting failures.
2. Real-time monitoring can significantly improve maintenance planning and reduce costs.
3. Implementing predictive maintenance could prevent sudden breakdowns and increase overall efficiency.
